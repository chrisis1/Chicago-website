<h2>Oudoor Activities in Chicago </h2>
<p>If you are a bike enthusiast, runner, or just like being outside, then Chicago offers a variety of outdoor activities. 
<dl>
<h3><dt>Lakefront trail</dt></h3>
<p><dd>It doesn’t get more Chicago than the Lakefront Trail. This 18-mile stretch along the
 shore of Lake Michigan runs from Kathy Osterman Beach in Lincoln Park to the South Shore Cultural Center, passing famous locales like Navy Pier and
 Grant Park while keeping the city’s skyline in constant view. In many ways, Lakefront is a marathoner-in-training’s dream: scenic and accessible, 
 with mile markers and drinking fountains throughout. And having access to a beautiful, clean lake to cool off in after (or during) a hot summer run
 is a pretty great perk.

<h3><dt>Kayak in Chicago</dt></h3>
<p><dd>If you enjoy or never been kayaking, now is the time to kayak in Chicago. Kayaking in Chicago is different from many other
locations because of the scenery. Paddle through various historical areas and take in all the beautiful views like the 
iconic Chicago skyline. <a href="https://kayakchicago.com/"target=_blank">For more information click here</a></dd></p>
<h3><dt>Boat Tour</dt></h3>
<p><dd>Get views of Chicago’s most famous buildings, as well as insider info from an expert guide, on this
 architecture-focused cruise. You’ll see all the most important buildings on one tour, a hard-to-accomplish task by foot. 
 View the skyline from the Chicago River while listening to live commentary. Snap photos of the Willis (Sears) Tower, Old Post Office, 360 Chicago 
 Observation Deck, Wrigley Building, and Aon Center.

 <h3><dt>Lincoln Park</dt></h3>
 <p><dd>DONT MISS!!!!Lincoln Park, the enormous 1,208-acre green space in the city’s North Side. A third bigger than New York’s Central Park, this
 lake-adjacent landmark boasts a zoo, conservatory, skate park, driving range and baseball fields. Not sure where to start? Join a guided
 walking tour of Lincoln Park to discover all the potential this park has to offer.

 <h3><dt>The 606</dt></h3>
 <p><dd>When the Bloomingdale Line became obsolete in the ’90s, the City of Chicago turned the elevated track into a public
 park. The 606 runs east to west on the North Side, connecting Logan Square, Humboldt Park, Wicker Park and Bucktown. On a nice day, the path can be 
 crowded with joggers, cyclists and tourists, but it’s still well worth a visit. And at just 2.7 miles long, this hike is manageable for anyone.
