<h2>Cultural and Theme</h2>
<p>If you are a fan of the mob figures like Al Capone, like Architecture, art, or other cultural activities and themes then Chicago has it all.
Below are five cultural and theme activities in Chicago. 
<dl>
<h3><dt>Chicago Cultural center</dt></h3>
<p><dd>Opened in 1897, the center is a true city landmark and worth a visit, if only to admire the building’s
 Tiffany mosaic glass dome and stunning Italian marble! There is loads more to it than that, of course, particularly when you learn that 
 the center features over 1,000 exhibitions and programs that cover an enormous range of literary, performing and visual arts, not to mention witnessing 
 presidents and dignitaries passing through its gracious doors. It is also headquarters for the Chicago Children’s Choir so check if there are any 
 performances while you are visiting the city. Entrance is free and you might even be fortunate enough to stumble into a piano recital or so! The whole family
 will enjoy the architecture and exhibits within this wonderful historic building.

 <h3><dt>Art Institute of Chicago</dt></h3>
 <p><dd>the Art Institute of Chicago houses a permanent collection of more than 300,000 artworks, displayed in a sprawling complex of 
 galleries and halls. You’ll find everything from Japanese prints to ancient Greek sculptures among the pieces housed in the museum’s central galleries, 
 where classic paintings such as Edward Hopper's Nighthawks and Grant Wood's American Gothic are also housed. 
 For something a bit more contemporary, head for the Modern Wing—a Renzo Piano-designed addition that displays the museum’s architecture and design
 collection as well as 20th and 21st century art.

 <h3><dt>Visit Pilsen</dt></h3>
 <p><dd>Pilsen is one of the most recognizable neighborhoods in the city. With a distinct mural or piece of public art adorning a facade in 
 nearly every block, it's not hard to see the artistic culture that's present in the Southwest Side area. With one of the best museums in the city, 
 some fantastic contemporary art galleries and a booming bar and restaurant scene to boot, Pilsen has everything a fun and culture-loving Chicagoan 
 could desire. It's accessible by way of bus, Pink Line, Metra or a quick hop off of the Eisenhower, Dan Ryan or Stevenson Expressways. Head to the 
 gorgeous Southwest Side 'hood and enjoy all the culture and entertainment it has to offer.
