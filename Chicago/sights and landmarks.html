<h2>Sights and Landmarks</h2>
<dl>
<dt><strong>Millennium Park</strong></dt>
<p><dd>Millennium Park is a portion of the 319-acre Grant Park, known as the "front lawn" of downtown Chicago, and has four major artistic highlights:
 the Jay Pritzker Pavilion, Cloud Gate, the Crown Fountain, and the Lurie Garden. Millennium Park is successful as a public art venue in part due to the grand
 scale of each piece and the open spaces for display. A showcase for postmodern architecture, it also features the McCormick Tribune Ice Skating Rink, the BP
 Pedestrian Bridge, the Joan W. and Irving B. Harris Theater for Music and Dance, Wrigley Square, the McDonald's Cycle Center, the Exelon Pavilions, the AT&T Plaza,
 the Boeing Galleries, the Chase Promenade, and the Nichols Bridgeway.
Millennium Park is considered one of the largest green roofs in the world, having been constructed on top of a railroad yard and large parking garages. The park,
 which is known for being user friendly, has a very rigorous cleaning schedule with many areas being swept, wiped down or cleaned multiple times a day. Although
 the park was unveiled in July 2004, some features opened earlier, and upgrades continued for some time afterwards. Along with the cultural features above ground (described below)
 the park has its own 2218-space parking garage.<a href="https://www.cityofchicago.org/city/en/depts/dca/supp_info/millennium_park.html"target="_blank">

<dt><strong>Willis Tower</strong></dt>
<p><dd>the Sears Tower remains one of the most popular tourist destinations in Chicago. Completed in 1973, the 108-story structure features some of the fastest
 elevators in the world, covering as much as 1,600 feet per minute. A 70-second ride takes visitors to the 103rd-floor Skydeck where they can feel the building
 sway beneath them on a windy day. The Skydeck offers of sweeping views of Lake Michigan and glimpses of the states of Michigan and Wisconsin beyond.

<dt><strong>Buckingham Fountain</strong></dt>
<p><dd>Located in Grant Park, the Beaux Arts-style Buckingham Fountain was designed by architect Edward Bennett after the Latona Fountain at Versailles. The font
 is famous for its grand size and for the height of its spray, which can reach as high as 15 stories. The fountain’s four water-spouting sea horse statues are said to
 represent the four states that surround Lake Michigan, while the fountain’s pool symbolizes the lake itself. The fountain was donated to the city by Kate Sturges Buckingham, 
 a patroness of the arts who inherited her family’s massive fortune at the age of 32.

<dt><strong>Navy Pier</dt></strong>
<p><dd>Chicago’s lakeshore playground, the Navy Pier includes gardens, restaurants and attractions. Built in 1916, the 1,000 meter (3,300 foot) long pier juts out of
 Lake Michigan and features a Ferris wheel, carousel and an IMAX theater. An ideal family destination, the site is also home to the Children’s Museum as well as the Smith Museum
 of Stained Glass Windows, which features more than 150 pieces, including 11 Tiffany windows.

<dt><strong>Magnificent Mile</dt></strong>
<p><dd>A section of Michigan Avenue that runs from Oak Street to the Chicago River, the Magnificent Mile is considered one the best shopping districts in the world.
 The street got its nickname from real estate magnate Arthur Rubloff in the 1940s. The “Mag Mile,” as its sometimes called, also provides access to many of the
 numerous landmarks and tourist attractions in Chicago, including the Museum of Contemporary Art, the Wrigley Building and the Chicago Water Tower.
